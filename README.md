# agarie's dotfiles

This repository has two purposes: to have all my dotfiles in one place, simplifying the setup process of a new system and to forcefully organize them.

For the moment, a small todo list is:

- Include .zshrc and whatever else is necessary, zshell-related.
- Provide a simple .bashrc when using a simple machine (e.g. remote server).
- Provide a simple shell script to "install" these files.
