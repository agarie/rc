# agarie's dotfiles

This repository has two purposes:

1. To have all my dotfiles in one place
2. Forcefully organize this mess

## Inspiration

I got a lot of "inspiration" (shamelessly copied) from these repositories:

- https://github.com/eevee/rc
- https://github.com/BurntSushi/dotfiles
- https://github.com/aihal/dotfiles
