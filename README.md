# agarie's dotfiles

I'm organizing this repository for two purposes: to have all my dotfiles in one place, simplifying the process of setupping a new system and to forcefully organize these files.

For the moment, a small todo list is:

- Include `.vim`
- Use submodules to handle `.vim` bundles
- Reorganize and clean `.profile`
- Include .zshrc and whatever else is necessary, zshell-related
- Provide a simple shell script to "install" these files.
