# agarie's dotfiles

This repository has two purposes: to have all my dotfiles in one place, simplifying the setup process of a new system and to forcefully organize them.

For the moment, a small todo list is:

- Reorganize and clean `.profile`
- Include .zshrc and whatever else is necessary, zshell-related
- Provide a simple shell script to "install" these files.
