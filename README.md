# agarie's dotfiles

This repository has two purposes: to have all my dotfiles in one place,
simplifying the setup process of a new system and to forcefully organize them.

For the moment, a small todo list is:

* Provide a simple .bashrc when using a simple machine (e.g. remote server).
* Organize XCompose, with comments re: each symbol and test everything to make sure no combination is competing with Xorg's defaults.
