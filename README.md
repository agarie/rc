# agarie's dotfiles

This repository has two purposes:

1. To have all my dotfiles in one place
2. Forcefully organize this mess

## A word of warning

Feel free to take inspiration from anything in this repository, but keep in
mind this is made to work with my current setup, so it might need some
tweaking. You can open an issue if you have suggestions and/or questions and
I'll try to help you whenever I can!
